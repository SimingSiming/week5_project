Social expectation with Neural Network Regression.


This is something I made in javascript because of the pressure coming from social expectation. \n

Once you run the code in p5.js, it will create a user interacted interface that allows you to play there. \n

# Instruction 
step1. Create humans by clicking your mouse on the screen. \n
step2. After creating enough humans, press 't' to train the the human trend. \n
step3. Wait for a moment allowing him to train, then press mouse again to see how your little human have moved toward those humans.
